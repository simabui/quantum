Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent un-authorized access.</p><h3><b>OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS</b></h3><p>We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking to track information about your use of our Website and Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third-party service providers may do so).<br><b>Cookies.</b> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer&rsquo;s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Website and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Website and Service. There are four types of cookie:<br><b>Strictly necessary cookies.</b> These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website. They include, for example, cookies that enable users to log into secure areas of our Website.<br><b>Analytical/performance cookies.</b> These types of cookies allow us to recognize, count the number of visitors, and see how visitors move around our Website when they are using it. This assists us to improve the way in which our Website works, for example, by ensuring that you can find what you are looking for easily.<br><b>Functionality cookies.</b> These cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our Website. They enable the personalization of content, recognition of users, and also remember your user preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).<br><b>Targeting cookies.</b> These cookies record your visit to our Website, the individual pages visited and the links followed. If the cookie is set by a third party (for example, an advertising network) which also monitors traffic on other websites, this type of cookie may also be used to track your movements across different websites and to create profiles of your general online behavior. Information collected by tracking cookies is commonly used to target online advertising.<br>The four types of cookies above will be either session cookies or persistent cookies.<br><b>Session Cookies.</b> Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Website or Services. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Website or Services.<br><b>Persistent Cookies.</b> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to remember your user information, preferences and activity, to enable us to provide our services to you when you next return to our Website or Services. We also use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information.<br><b>Local Storage Objects.</b> We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") to store your Website preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookie because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose &ldquo;Global Storage Settings Panel&rdquo; and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose &ldquo;Website Storage Settings Panel&rdquo; and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.<br><b>Storage HTML5 Storage.</b> We may also store your user information and Website preferences locally within your web browser via HTML5.<br><b>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</b> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer&rsquo;s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Website or Services to, among other things, track the activities of Website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Website and Services usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.<br><b>Changing or Disabling your Cookie Settings.</b> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Website who disable their web browsers&rsquo; ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Website; however, most site features will not function if you disable cookies and you will not be able to login to use our services.<br><b>Do Not Track.</b> Currently, our systems do not honor browser &ldquo;do-not-track&rdquo; requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed above (e.g., by disabling Cookies); you also may opt-out of Third Party Analytics or targeted advertising.</p><h3><b>THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS</b></h3><p>We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, Yandex.Metrika and Clicky to evaluate use of our Website and the Services. To opt-out of Google Analytics, please go to: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptocout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>. Please note that if you use a new or different computer, install a new browser, or clear your cookies; in that case, you will need to re-opt-out through the link above. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. These third parties may collect your device ID, IP address, or other information about your use of the Services as part of the analytics they provide to us.</p><h3><b>THIRD-PARTY AD NETWORKS</b></h3><p>We use third parties, such as network advertisers and other marketing agents, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Website and unrelated third-party websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party&rsquo;s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your use of our Website and our Services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Website and users of our Service. You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (&ldquo;NAI&rdquo;) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (&ldquo;DAA&rdquo;). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: <a href="www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> (NAI) and <a href="www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> (DAA). Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Website or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or mobile device or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI&rsquo;s and DAA&rsquo;s websites accessible by the above links.</p><h3><b>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY & COOKIES POLICY</b></h3><p>This Policy may change from time to time.
